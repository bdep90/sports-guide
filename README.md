###### Approach
Our application is a beginner's sports guide.    
We implemented `Bootstrap` and `Jade` in our front-end, and we implemented `Node`, `Express`, and `Mongoose` in our back-end. As of this moment, soccer is the only featured sport.

###### Technologies Used
- `Express`: to build app
- `Node.js`: to build app
- `Heroku`: to deploy app
- `Bcrypt`: to authenticate user
- `Body-parser`: to parse data
- `Bootstrap`: to manage front-end (HTML, CSS, and Javascript)
- `Express`: to build app
- `Express-jwt`: to build token feature
- `fs`: to build app
- `Jade`: to create templates
- `Jsonwebtoken`: to build token feature
- `jQuery`: to manipulate front-end
- `Mongojs`: to link `News`/Twitter feature and database
- `Mongoose`: to build database
- `Morgan`: to log requests
- `Nodemailer`: to build `Contact Us` feature
- `Path`: to build paths
- `Postman`: to test app functionality on server-side
- `Request`: to build app
- `Require`: to build app
- `Twitter`: to access Twitter API data

###### Installation Instructions

###### Major Hurdles
- Finding well-organized public sports data
- Implementation of tokens: solved by using `Postman` to test user routes
- Accessing and rendering soccer API data: solved by reading documentation on JSON parsing
- Accessing and rendering Twitter API data: solved by using `Mongojs` to create collection in database and seed it with tweets pulled from Twitter API
